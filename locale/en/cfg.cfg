explorer-formula-graphs-header=Graphs:
explorer-formula-graphs-explanation=Attached to each characteristic are a set of graphs. These let you explore how the fuels will act under different circumstances. Be sure to play around and find out what affects what!
explorer-formula-graphs-but-how-do-they-work-header=But how do they work?
explorer-formula-graphs-but-how-do-they-work-explanation=The "variable" field (dropdown) selects which variable is changed along the X axis. This variable goes from 0 - Maximum value along the X axis, and it's output is displayed on the Y axis. Use the cursor slider to see what value it is precisely.
explorer-formula-graphs-power-header=Power
explorer-formula-graphs-power-explanation=This displays the output power (in MW) This depends on the rods [color=#fdeacc]output flux[/color] not it's input flux!
explorer-formula-graphs-flux-header=Flux output
explorer-formula-graphs-flux-explanation=This displays the output flux (in slow and fast). This depends on the rods [color=#fdeacc]input flux[/color]!
explorer-formula-graphs-efficiency-header=Efficiency
explorer-formula-graphs-efficiency-explanation=This displays how efficient the rod is in percent. This depends on the rods [color=#fdeacc]input flux[/color]!
explorer-formula-graphs-example-header=For example:
explorer-formula-graphs-example-explanation=Take the Uranium fuel characteristic. It has a simple flux output formula: it outputs 2.5x the input slow flux with 90% of it being slow and 10% of it being fast. This can be seen by setting the variable to "slow flux". If you set it to "temperature" or "fast flux" you can see they both have no effect.\nPower is simple too: slow flux + fast flux. Set the variable to either "slow flux" or "fast flux" and observe.\nEfficiency is more complicated: it depends on both temperature and fast flux. You can set the variable to "temperature" and add additional fast flux with the fast flux slider or set the variable to "fast flux" and add additional temperature with it's respective slider.
explorer-formula-common-formulas-header=Common formulas:
explorer-formula-common-formulas-explanation=  -Most fuels have their power as simply [font=default-semibold]slow flux + fast flux[/font].\n  -Temperature does not affect slow or fast flux for most fuels.\n  -Temperature affects efficiency for most fuels.


explorer-neutron-flux-label=Neutron flux (η)
explorer-neutron-flux-explanation=Neutron flux can be considered a measure of reactivity. At higher power levels, most rods give out more neutron flux. It is represented by the unit [font=default-semibold]η[/font], and uses SI prefixes.
explorer-neutron-flux-where-does-it-come-from=Where does it come from?
explorer-neutron-flux-comes-from-fuel-rods=Fuel rods emit neutron flux in each cardinal direction, raycasting for a certain amount of tiles (their affection distance) before stopping.
explorer-neutron-flux-where-does-it-go=Where does it go?
explorer-neutron-flux-is-consumed=Neutron flux is consumed by fuel rods proportional to their cross-section (measured in % absorption). The nuclear fuel then emits neutron flux proportional to the input flux, according to it's formula.
explorer-neutron-flux-what-is-slow-fast=What is "slow" and "fast" flux?
explorer-neutron-flux-speed-explanation=Fuels emit both fast (ηF) and slow (ηS) neutron flux. Different fuels consume different amounts of slow and fast flux, so consult the formulas. Do note: moderator rods convert fast flux to slow flux!
explorer-neutron-flux-how-do-i-control-it=How do I control it?
explorer-neutron-flux-control-rods=Control rods absorb between 0% and 100% of the flux passing through them, use them in conjuction with circuits to prevent a catastrophe!

explorer-reactor-label=Modular reactors
explorer-reactor-explanation=Modular reactors are the backbone of CYR. Composed of many "rods", they are able to product heat energy highly efficiently. Although be warned: proper control systems are necessary! These reactors are not fire and forget. To understand how to assemble and control one of these reactors be sure to read up on:

explorer-control-rod-label=Control rods
explorer-control-rod-explanation=Control rods are used to control the flow of neutron flux throughout a reactor. Using the circuit network, you can allow between 0% and 100% of neutron flux through each rod.
explorer-control-rod-modes=Control modes:
explorer-control-rod-mode-normal=Normal:
explorer-control-rod-mode-normal-explanation=Send the "S" virtual signal on either [item=green-wire] or [item=red-wire]. Ranges from 0-1000. 0 is no insertion, 1000 is 100%.\n[color=#fdeacc]100% insertion means 0% of neutron flux is allowed through![/color]
explorer-control-rod-mode-group=Group:
explorer-control-rod-mode-group-explanation=Reactor interfaces can be set to be [color=#ecd378][font=default-bold]group controllers[/font][/color] which are very powerful. If a control rod and an interface share a group id, the "S" signal can be sent to the interface instead, allowing for much fewer wires to be used.

explorer-moderator-rod-label=Moderator rods
explorer-moderator-rod-explanation=Moderator rods, simply put, convert between 0% and 100% of fast neutron flux passing through them into slow neutron flux. That's it.

explorer-reflector-rod-label=Reflector rods
explorer-reflector-rod-explanation=Reflector rods reflect all neutron flux that hits them, perfectally. Because rods only produce flux in the four cardinal directions, the reflections will also always be in one of the four cardinal directions.
explorer-reflector-rod-bounce-distance=Bounce distance:
explorer-reflector-rod-bounce-distance-explanation=After a bounce, neutrons will travel <= this bounce distance.
explorer-reflector-rod-bounce-limit=Bounce limit:
explorer-reflector-rod-bounce-limit-explanation=Neutrons can only bounce this many times. If they have bounced more times before, they are not reflected, and pass through instead.

explorer-fuel-rod-label=Fuel rods
explorer-fuel-rod-explanation=Fuel rods are the most important part of any working nuclear reactor. They convert incoming [color=#ecd378][font=default-bold]neutron flux[/font][/color] into power depending on which fuel is inserted.\nThey work by emitting neutron flux in the four cardinal directions. As an example: If a fuel rod burning uranium recieved 2ηS it would emit 1.125ηF and 0.125ηS in each direction. The first fuel rod within it's affectable distance then would recieve 1.125ηF * fast coeff (0.5) and 0.125ηF * (0.5). The second fuel rod would recieve 0.5625ηF * fast coeff and 0.0625ηS * slow coeff. (output - output * coeff). In this way, neutron flux is consumed by fuel rods - no extra flux is created when traversing many fuel rods.\nEach fuel rod has it's flux/power/efficiency calculated exactly [color=#fdeacc]once per second[/color] and input flux is averaged over two seconds. (Effectively, they update their flux every two seconds.)\nThey have many important stats:
explorer-fuel-rod-stat-meltdown-header=Meltdown temperature:
explorer-fuel-rod-stat-slow-cross-section-header=Slow neutron cross section:
explorer-fuel-rod-stat-fast-cross-section-header=Fast neutron cross section:
explorer-fuel-rod-stat-meltdown=At this temperature many bad things will happen. The fuel rods will pop their lids, spewing radioactive black smoke across your beautiful factory. The exposed rods will catch ablaze and destroy what remaining infrastructure is left.
explorer-fuel-rod-stat-slow-cross-section=This value dictates how much of the slow flux going across this rod is absorbed by the fuel, contributing to power. Typically fairly high.
explorer-fuel-rod-stat-fast-cross-section=This value dictates how much of the fast flux going across this rod is absorbed by the fuel, contributing to power. Typically fairly low.
explorer-fuel-rod-fuel-supply-header=Fuel supply
explorer-fuel-rod-fuel-supply-explanation=Request a minimum and maximum amount of a certain fuel to request. If the fuel level drops below the minimum, it is filled to the maximum.
explorer-fuel-rod-waste-removal-header=Waste removal
explorer-fuel-rod-waste-removal-explanation=All waste is automatically sent to any reactor interfaces that are requesting that type of waste.

explorer-interface-label=Reactor interface
explorer-interface-explanation=A reactor interface is how you assemble your reactor, and supply it with fuel. [color=#ecd378][font=default-bold]Your reactors won't work without one![/font][/color]
explorer-interface-mode-header=Modes:
explorer-interface-mode-input-header=Input
explorer-interface-mode-input-explanation=Input your nuclear fuel into the interface, and through the power of *magic* it will be transported to any fuel rods that are requesting that fuel!
explorer-interface-mode-output-header=Output
explorer-interface-mode-output-explanation=Set which item it should grab, and through the power of *magic* spent fuel rods matching the filter will be deposited!
explorer-interface-mode-group-header=Group controller
explorer-interface-mode-group-explanation=Set the group ID to any number, and if a control rod has the same ID, it will be controlled by this interface! Send the signal "S" on either [item=red-wire] or [item=green-wire], from 0-1000 to control your rods.
